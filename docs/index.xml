      <description>Ivan Sutherland speak about powerfull technologies such as eye tracking but he also speak about technologies wich were just created at his time (such as the mouse, sketchpad, or plotting dots on a screen), his Vision of the Ultimate Display is more an area between Augmented Reality and Augmented Virtuality or even Virtual Reality. Indeed some of the technologies he speak about are more about Augmented Reality than Virtual Reality. But on the other side he speak about being able to see and sense things, such as purely mathematical phenomenon or complex physics phenomenom which are impossible to sense and see in Reality.</description>

      <description>My first scenarios is about the security of wearing a virtual headset. Nowadays it&amp;rsquo;s quite safe because it&amp;rsquo;s used indoor, sometimes it needs a guardian (ex : Oculus Quest) which allows the user to play only in a closed area. On the internet we can watch many fails and accidents due to the use of VR headset but it&amp;rsquo;s still quite safe because it&amp;rsquo;s always indoor in a limited area. Using a headset outside could be far more dangerous.</description>

      <description>This homework was instantly done for me because I already had Unity before. I just had had to download a new version compatible with the project. So this post will be quite empty because I had nothing to do here</description>

      <description>For my blog, I used Hugo. I chose Hugo because it was my first blog and everything about the setup was explain in the slides so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard to setup the blog. The theme that I used is named binario.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter major obstacles since each steps of the setup was explained in the slides. The few problems I had are stupid mistakes with Git and mistakes when testing the blog.</description>
