				<h1 class="entry__title">Lab homework 3 : Unity Roll-A-Ball</h1>
				<div class="entry__content"><p>In the Roll-a-ball tutorial i didn&rsquo;t really had difficulties because the tutorial is pretty well explained. But I learned many usefull things about Unity. The goal of this project is to create a game in which the player controls a ball in a closed field thanks to the directionnal arrows. The ball have to hit cubes in order to collect them and increase the player&rsquo;s score.</p>
<p>First I learned the main component of a scene : the GameObjects, the lights, the materials, etc&hellip; . Then I learned how to play with the physic of a GameObject by using his rigidbody and applying forces on it. We also learned one of the most important component of a Unity project : the script. A script is a code with parameters, in which some functions are called when an event occur. So here we just create a script to apply forces on the ball when input events occur.</p>

<p>In the next part we create a new script to make the camera moving with the ball. And here I discovered another important element : the Transform component, it contains the position, rotation and scale of an object. We manipulate this component in scripts and it&rsquo;s really powerfull because it give a lot of controll on GameObjects. Later I discovered the prefabs, it allows to create several similar objects and modify all of them at the same time. Then I learned how to manage collision by using the OnTriggerEnter() function and by using some parameters such as IsTrigger, isKinematic or UseGravity. When a GameObject with IsTrigger collides with a GameObject with the function OnTriggerEnter() in a script, this function is called. An object with IsKinematic is independant of forces. Then I learned how to display text. I understood a lot of Unity basics in this tutorial</p>

<p>Then the next step was to adapt this game in VR. I didn&rsquo;t encounter too much obstacles since everything was explained in the slides. We first have to create a new project and import the package of Oculus Integration, and then import a package which contains the elements of our classic roll-a-ball game. I learned how to use the input from the Oculus controllers. In this example we just have to check the value of the trigger. Eventually I learned about the layers. It was the hardest part of this lab because I spend a long time time to understand. The main idea is that elements from distinct layers can&rsquo;t interact together. So here, the ball, the walls and the collectibles aren&rsquo;t on the same layer as the collider of the board and the controllers. This lab was quite interesting because I realised that it&rsquo;s not that hard to create a VR game</p>
