				<div class="entry__content"><p>My first scenarios is about the security of wearing a virtual headset. Nowadays it&rsquo;s quite safe because it&rsquo;s used indoor, sometimes it needs a guardian (ex : Oculus Quest) which allows the user to play only in a closed area. On the internet we can watch many fails and accidents due to the use of VR headset but it&rsquo;s still quite safe because it&rsquo;s always indoor in a limited area. Using a headset outside could be far more dangerous. here is my scenario : a society develop a game like Pokemon Go but which recquire VR headset (we imagine VR headset which could be able to work perfectly on a infinite space outside). This game would be really dangerous for the users. Firstly there are already accidents inside of houses because of VR, &hellip; outside it could be far more dangerous. Outside the users could be hit by other people, cars, bikes, there are far more potential dangers and moving objects outside. Moreover there was already accident with Pokemon Go because people where too focused on the game while walking in the street. I think that wearing a VR headset outside could only be worst because the users is more present in his game and would be more focus on it&hellip;it means the users would be less focus on others potential dangers. Eventually, the interface of the game could be quite invasive and hide important element surrounding the player. For example a simple interface showing the current pokemon of the player could hide a car whih is coming. an d I think that it&rsquo;s a big issue because some game could have really invasive interface.</p>
