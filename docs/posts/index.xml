      <description>For my blog, I used Hugo. I chose Hugo because it was my first blog and everything about the setup was explain in the slides so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too hard to setup the blog. The theme that I used is named binario.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter major obstacles since each steps of the setup was explained in the slides. The few problems I had are stupid mistakes with Git and mistakes when testing the blog.</description>
