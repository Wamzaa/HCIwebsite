	<div class="entry__content">Introduction
My locomotion technique is based on the 3 dimensional maneuver gear from the famous manga named Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin). The main idea is to use two grappling hooks in order to be hooked to buildings or trees and then to move around them.
Each grappling hook is controlled by one oculus quest controller (independantly from the other grappling hook). The player use raycasting in order to point to a surface.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">3D Maneuver Gear
My first locomotion technique is based on the three dimensional maneuver gear from the famous manga named Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin). In the manga the characters are using grappling hooks to move around buildings or trees. Each character has one controller in each hand, a gas tank and a grappling hook launcher on each side, and a gas evacuation system in the back. Thanks to the controllers they can send a grappling hook on a surface, pull back the grappling hook, pull on the rope fixed to the grappling hook in order to be closer to the surface they are hooked to.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">In the Roll-a-ball tutorial i didn&rsquo;t really had difficulties because the tutorial is pretty well explained. But I learned many usefull things about Unity. The goal of this project is to create a game in which the player controls a ball in a closed field thanks to the directionnal arrows. The ball have to hit cubes in order to collect them and increase the player&rsquo;s score.
First I learned the main component of a scene : the GameObjects, the lights, the materials, etc&hellip; .</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Ivan Sutherland speak about powerfull technologies such as eye tracking but he also speak about technologies which were just created at his time (such as the mouse, sketchpad, or plotting dots on a screen), his vision of the Ultimate Display is more like an area between Augmented Reality and Augmented Virtuality or even Virtual Reality. Indeed some of the technologies he speak about are more about Augmented Reality than Virtual Reality.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">My first scenario is about the security of wearing a virtual headset. Nowadays it&rsquo;s quite safe because it&rsquo;s used indoor, sometimes it needs a guardian (ex : Oculus Quest) which allows the user to play only in a closed area. On the internet we can watch many fails and accidents due to the use of VR headsets but it&rsquo;s still quite safe because it&rsquo;s always indoor in a limited area. Using a headset outside could be far more dangerous.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">For my blog, I used Hugo. I&rsquo;ve chosen Hugo because it was my first blog and everything about the setup was explained in the slides so it wasn&rsquo;t too hard to setup the blog. The theme that I used is named binario.
I didn&rsquo;t encounter major obstacles since each steps of the setup was explained in the slides. The few problems I had are stupid mistakes with Git and mistakes when testing the blog.</div>
