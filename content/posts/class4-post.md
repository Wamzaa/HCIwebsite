I showed my project to different friends. Two friends which are no longer studying in Telecom Paris told me that it was pretty cool and fun. Two others friends which are following this class have evaluated my locomotion technique. 

Here are the results :

| Student |Round time|Accuracy|Cyber-Sickness|Presence|Finished Rounds|Fun|
|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Me       |55.9      |0.04    |4       |9       |9       |9       |
|Student 1|57        |0.1     |5       |9       |2       |9       |
|Student 2|71        |0.03    |4       |8       |1       |8       |
|Average  |61.3      |0.057   |4.3     |8.7     |4       |8.7     |


So we can see that cyber-sickness is a bit high and the accuracy is terribly low. Even if this locomotion technique is really fast, it's really hard to catch coins and this parkour is not adapted to this locomotion technique. That's also why the time to finish a round is high : we spend too much time to fail at catching coins. I was able to finsih the parkour in about 15 seconds if I don't care about coins. So it's really fast but not precise at all. I think that it's normal because before implementing the project, with Jan we agreed that it would be really hard to control this locomotion technique.

But the good news are that the amount of fun and the presence are incredibly high. I'm really happy with that because presence and fun were the main goals of this locomotion technique. My dream of controlling the 3D maneuver gear from my favorite manga was finally achieved.
