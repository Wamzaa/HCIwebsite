Ivan Sutherland speak about powerfull technologies such as eye tracking but he also speak about technologies which were just created at his time (such as the mouse, sketchpad, or plotting dots on a screen), his vision of the Ultimate Display is more like an area between Augmented Reality and Augmented Virtuality or even Virtual Reality. Indeed some of the technologies he speak about are more about Augmented Reality than Virtual Reality. But on the other side he speak about being able to see and sense things, such as purely mathematical phenomenon or complex physics phenomenom which are impossible to sense and see in Reality. I think it refers more to Virtual Reality because to sense that kind of strange phenomenom we need more presence which is easier to achieve with Virtual Reality than with Mixed Reality.
