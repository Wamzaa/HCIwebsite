My first scenario is about the security of wearing a virtual headset. Nowadays it's quite safe because it's used indoor, sometimes it needs a guardian (ex : Oculus Quest) which allows the user to play only in a closed area. On the internet we can watch many fails and accidents due to the use of VR headsets but it's still quite safe because it's always indoor in a limited area. Using a headset outside could be far more dangerous. 

Here is my scenario : a company develop a AR game like Pokemon Go but which recquires VR headsets (we imagine VR headsets which could work perfectly on a infinite space outside). The idea is that the player has to wear a VR headset but think he still have control because it's only AR so he can see the real world. This game would be really dangerous for the users. Firstly there are already accidents inside of houses because of VR, ... outside it could be far more dangerous. Outside the users could be hit by other people, cars, bikes, there are far more potential dangers and moving objects outside. Moreover there was already accident with Pokemon Go because people where too focused on the game while walking in the street. I think that wearing a VR headset outside could only be worst because the user is more present in his game and would be more focus on it...it means the users would be less focus on others potential dangers. 

Eventually, the interface of the game could be quite invasive and hide important elements surrounding the player. For example a simple interface showing the current pokemon of the player could hide a car which is coming. And I think that it's a big issue because some game could have really invasive interface. For me there are 2 solutions. 
- Preventing the use of VR headsets outside everywhere in the street. We could imagine players playing outside but in a limited space such as a closed field
- Creating really strict security measures in the development of AR games. For example, some laws could forbid too invasive interfaces, ... Or we could ask to these game to also detect potential dangers in order to warn the player

My second scenario is quite similar but a bit different. In this scenario we are living in a society which rely a lot on VR technologies and in we which people have to wear a VR headset in order to drive a car. There could be many benefits, for example the road sign could be removed, and the augmented reality application used to drive could help the drivers by giving him more information on the road. 

But the main issue is that, even if the interface is really clear and do not hide objects from the road, we rely too much on technologies. The headset could run out of energy, there could be some bugs which shut down the headset or the application,... . Although there are a lot of benefits, it could be the source of terrible accidents because wearing a headset which is off while driving is a nightmare. It's diferent from my first scenario because here the issue comes from unespected bugs on the software or the hardware, it doesn't come from the design of the interface or the degree of implication of the player.

The best way to prevent these issues is to forbid the use of VR technologies while driving.
